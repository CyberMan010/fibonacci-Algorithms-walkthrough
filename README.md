__Hi, I am Mohamad Hasoun a J.Full Stack Developer__
**Welcome to my Algorithms Walkthrough Repo !**
## This is the information which I've collected through the first semseter
And it is all my legal studies results from UC San Diego from Coursera

# Learning Outcomes
## Upon completing this programming assignment you will be able to:
__1. See the huge difference between a slow algorithm and a fast one.__
__2. Play with examples where knowing something interesting about a problem helps to design an algorithm
that is much faster than a naive one.__
**3. Implement solutions that work much more faster than straightforward solutions for the following programming challenges:**
__(a) compute a small Fibonacci number;__
__(b) compute the last digit of a large Fibonacci number;__
__(c) compute a huge Fibonacci number modulo ùëö;__
__(d) compute the last digit of a sum of Fibonacci numbers;__
__(e) compute the last digit of a partial sum of Fibonacci numbers;__
__(f) compute the greatest common divisor of two integers;__
__(g) compute the least common multiple of two integers.__
**4. Implement the algorithms covered in the lectures, design new algorithms.**
**5. Practice implementing, testing, and debugging your solution. In particular, you will find out how in**

_practice, when you implement an algorithm, you bump into unexpected questions and problems not
covered by the general description of the algorithm. You will also check your understanding of the
algorithm itself and most probably see that there are some aspects you did not think of before you
had to actually implement it. You will overcome all those complexities, implement the algorithms, test
them, debug, and submit to the system._
